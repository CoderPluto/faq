## Warnings

#### Q: What are warnings and warning points?
**A:** Warnings are formal notices of rule violations. Each warning has a set warning point associated to it and depending on the severity of rule violation, you may have a higher amount of points added to your account. 

#### Q: When do I get a posting suspension?
**A:** If you get too many points, you may get a posting suspension. Posting suspensions are based off the points you receive not the warning type you get. Below are the amount of points and the length of suspension.

| Points | Posting Ban |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | No ban |
| 2 | 3 Days |
| 3 | 5 Days |
| 4 | 7 Days |
| 5 | 14 Days | 
| 6+ | 30 Days |

#### Q: Can other people see my warnings?
**A:** No, only members of the staff and yourself can view your warnings.

#### Q: How do I lower my infraction level?
**A:** Every 30 days, you loose one point from your warning level. 

#### Q: I received a warning but I'm not quite sure why I got it, what can I do?
**A:** If you're not sure, you can go ahead and respond to the warning message and ask the moderator why. They'd be more than happy to tell you why you got the warning.

#### Q: I don't believe the warning I got was fair! What can I do?
**A:** If you'd like to appeal your warning, go to your profile and click "Warning & Bans". Then, click on "Appeal". Please note: The staff member processing your appeal will not be the staff member who issued you the warning.

#### Q: Does my post break the rules?
**A:** If you aren't sure if your post follows the rules, you can [contact a staff member of that section](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/forums/forum-discussion-info/517684-staff-list) and they'd be more than happy to help you. Don't worry, you won't get a warning for asking.
