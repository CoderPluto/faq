# General

#### Q: Where do I find the forum rules?
A: General forum rules, that apply to each section, are found [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/rules).
The forum rules for each section can be found at that link too, or at the top of each forum page. For instance, if I want to find the rules for Mapping & Modding, I can visit any (sub-)section of Mapping & Modding and click [this](http://i.imgur.com/Yg0jDNK.png) link at the top.

#### Q: How do Forum Notifications work?
A: When you have subscribed to a thread, you [receive a notification at the top left](http://i.imgur.com/WxnB3wC.png) for the latest comment that was posted in that thread. When clicking on that icon, you see a dropdown with all notifications received. When clicking on "See All Notifications" at the bottom, you can see all notifications you got from a thread. These notifications are sorted by date and hierarchically structured, indented ones being from the same thread as the less indented one above.

#### Q: How do I report content?
A: If you see a member breaking forum rules, you can use the [report button at the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/83Ll8US.png) of the rule infringing post and select the appropriate reason from the dropdown menu. A moderator will get to the report as soon as possible.

#### Q: How/Where can I receive support?
A: You can request and receive support from [this page](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/support).
