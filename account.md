#### Q: How do I change my forum username?
**A:** In order to change your username, you need to contact Curse support. More information on how to do this is outlined [here](http://support.curse.com/hc/en-us/articles/204270285-How-do-I-change-my-Curse-Account-name-). You only get one username change, though.

#### Q: How do I change my avatar?
**A:** You can change your avatar by visiting [this](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/avatars) link or hovering over your name in the top right corner of the webpage and selecting "Change Avatar" ([reference]()). There is no minimum size for an avatar, but ideally, they're the same width and height.

#### Q: Can I upload an animated avatar?
**A:** Yes, you can. However, they must go though a process before they are animated on the site. As such, they might show as static images for a short amount of time.

#### Q: How do I change my signature?
**A:** You can edit your signature by visiting [this](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/profile) link. Scroll down a bit until you see "Signature" and start editing. There are no limits to your signature.

#### Q: What's this text under my username? What are post ranks? Can I change it?
**A:** This is your title (or post rank). The more posts you get, the more titles you unlock. They are purely visual and have no effect on your account. You can change what is being displayed at any time in your settings [right here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/titles). You cannot create your own title.

#### Q: Why doesn't my post count increase?
**A:** Some sections, such as Forum Games and Forum Roleplaying, do not increase your post count as they are purely for fun and don't create any valuable discussion. For instance, threads like "Count to x until y happens" could be used to "farm" forum posts if the post count would increase.

#### Q: What are "thanks"? How do I earn them?
**A:** "Thanks" are a way of showing that forum members like your posts. They are obtained when someone clicks [this]() green arrow in the bottom left of your post. The number next to it shows how many thanks the member has received for this specific post. If you like someones content, feel free to give them a thanks to show them your support!

#### Q: I want my account deleted, or all of my posts deleted. How do I do that?
**A:** You can contact Curse support [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/support) or, if you want your account deleted, you can find more info [here](http://support.curse.com/hc/en-us/articles/207676876-How-do-I-delete-my-Minecraft-Forums-account-).
