#### Q: How can I change the title or prefixes of a thread I've already created?
**A:** Navigate to the thread you would like to change and look for the green button named "Tools" located in the upper right area of your thread. Hover over this button and look for the "Edit Thread" option. Upon clicking this, you will see two different options, prefix and title. To edit the title of your thread, just edit the text box to your liking. To change prefixes, you can either click the x's on existing prefixes to remove them, or click on the box to bring up a full list of prefixes available to add. When you're done making all your changes, you can click the "Edit Thread" button in the bottom right to save your changes and return to your thread.

#### Q: How do I post an image or screenshot?
**A:** You can embed images into your posts by clicking the "Insert/edit image" button in the post editor. If you already have a link to the image you want to embed in your post, just put it in the source option and then press OK. The description and dimensions options are optional. If you don't already have a link to the image and have it on your computer instead, you'll need to upload it somewhere. We recommend that you use [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), a popular, reliable and free image hosting service. Click the upload images button at the top, and then either select the image from your computer or drag and drop it on the page, then click start upload. Once it's done, you'll need to get the direct link to the image. In most browsers, you can right click the image and there will be an option to either open image in a new tab or open the direct image. Click this and copy the URL of the image, you can now put this URL in the source option and click OK to insert the image into your post.
